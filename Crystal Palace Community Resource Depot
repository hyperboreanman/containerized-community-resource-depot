Welcome to my epic recycling project. I hope to create a community around this vision in order to develope the nessasary hardware and software that would enable anyone world wide to duplicate the system. So yes, I want to open source the entire business model. Why the name crystal palace and community resources depots? In a nut shell my vision is to mine all landfills and convert community waste streams into reinforced alkali activated concrete shipping containers made from the landfill waste. What applications do I want host in the containers you ask? You guessed it, community resouce depots. A community resource depot is a solar powered green house make out of concrete containers with lots of recycled glass panels in them. The resources that are provided by said container greenhouse is hydroponicly grown food, purified water, electric charging station for bikes and cars, a recycling center, a local products kiosk and a small cafe. When depositing materials into our bins, a token is awarded to our recyclers. This token can be used to purchase the various products that I mentioned that we are generating within this Crystal Palace. Money is not excepted. We want to build a new circular economy and get off of the debt slave model that fiat represents. As you can imagine, there are a vast array of components that go into a Crystal Palce
